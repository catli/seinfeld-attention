### Seinfeld Attention

You know why we're here? To learn attention, that's right attention model. And now that I have your attention, what better way to learn it then to train a question and answer model that can answer all your questions in seinfeld's voice.


#### [WIP]
Steps to clean scripts (codify):  
1) copy direct from website (space-delimited text)  
[TODO: add the below logic to process_data.py]
2) remove actions in brackets  
3) change words not in fasttext dictionary like "heeeey" to closest approximation like "heeey", and convert made-up conjuction like "overdie" to "over-die"  
4) concate the speaker into one string, without space  
5) create a space between punctuation and words [.,?;!]  
6) delete apostrophes for shorten words like "it's"
