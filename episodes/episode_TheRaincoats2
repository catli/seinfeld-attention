GEORGE	How	gee	what	a	coincidence	.
ALEC	And	youll	send	me	a	postcard	.
AARON	Helen	really	seemed	to	respond	to	Renoir	.	I	think	she	really	connected	to	the	way	he	painted	children	.
ELAINE	Mm	hmm	.
AARON	And	that	Morty	,	Ill	tell	ya	that	guy	is	full	of	life	.	He	was	convinced	Monet	was	near	sighted	.	I	kept	telling
ELAINE
AARON	Yes	?
ELAINE	Uh	,	let	me	ask	you	a	question	.	How	come	you	asked	Mr	.	and	Mrs	.	Seinfeld	to	go	to	the	museum	with	you	?
AARON	Well	,	they	were	in	from	out	of	town	,	I	thought	they	would	enjoy	it	.
ELAINE	Uhuh	,	um	you	didnt	feel	uncomfortable	spending	the	whole	day	at	the	museum	with	two	complete	strangers	who	were	more	than	twice	your	age	?
AARON	No	,	it	was	fun	.

AARON	Yea	,	they	bought	me	a	coke	.
KRAMER	So	howd	you	come	up	with	the	idea	for	the	belt-less	trench	coat	?
MORTY	I	came	home	one	night	,	and	I	tripped	over	one	of	Jerrys	toys	.	So	I	took	out	my	belt	just	to	threaten	him	,	and	I	got	a	glimpse	of	myself	in	the	mirror	.
KRAMER	How	serendipitous	.
MORTY	So	that	night	I	cut	off	the	loops	and	the	Executive	was	born	.
KRAMER
JERRY	He	also	came	up	with	an	idea	for	a	brimless	rain-hat	but	that	never	materialized	.	Alright	come	on	lets	play	.
