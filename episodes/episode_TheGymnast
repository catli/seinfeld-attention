JERRY	Kramer	,	yknow	,	guys	like	you	,	with	no	conscience	,	dont	know	what	its	like	for	guys	like	me	.	Im	in	the	unfortunate	position	of	having	to	consider	peoples	feelings	.

JERRY	No	.
KRAMER	Tantric	yoga	?

JERRY	Boy	,	you	can	really	talk	some	trash	.	I	guess	thats	better	than	eating	it	.

JERRY	All	right	.
GEORGE	Did	you	pass	your	stone	yet	?

JERRY	How	did	you	stay	on	that	beam	like	that	?	I	mean	,	its	only	this	wide	!
KATYA	I	can	balance	myself	in	any	position	.
KATYA	It	is	amazing	after	years	of	training	how	one	can	contort	ones	body	.	Of	course	,	it	is	only	useful	in	gymnastics	.
JERRY	Oh	boy	.		.		.
JERRY	I	couldnt	believe	it	.	Uh	,	I	mean	I	thought	I	was	entering	a	magical	world	of	sensual	delights	,	but	it	was	just	so	ordinary	.	I	mean	,	there	was	nothing	gymnastic	about	it	.
ELAINE	Well	,	what	did	you	think	she	was	gonna	do	?
JERRY	Well	,	you	know	.	I	mean	.		.		.	I	dunno	.

LINDSAY	Sure	.
ANNOUNCER	Ladies	and	gentlemen	,	could	I	direct	your	attention	to	the	center	ring	,	where	the	incomparable	Misha	will	balance	ten	stories	above	the	circus	floor	on	a	wire	no	wider	than	a	human	thumb	.
MISHA	It	is	time	.
JERRY	Well	,	break	a	leg	.
JERRY	Eh	,	show	biz	.		.		.
ANNOUNCER	Ladies	and	gentlemen	,	the	incomparable	Misha	!
JERRY	Boy	,	those	capes	are	really	coming	back	.
GUEST	Oh	,	sorry	I	took	so	long	.	Theyve	got	one	of	those	-D	art	posters	in	there	.	Its	mesmerizing	.
JERRY	What	is	that	sound	?
KATYA	It	is	horrible	!
GEORGE	Whew	!	Anybody	see	that	poster	in	there	?	That	is	weird	,	wild	stuff	,	huh	?	Whew	!
PITT	I	have	been	accused	of	wrong-doing	.	But	these	false	accusations	will	not	deter	us	.	We	WILL	annex	Poland	by	the	Spring	,	at	any	cost	!	AND	.		.		.	our	stock	will	rise	HIGH	!
KATYA	Hell	be	all	right	.	I	must	go	and	be	with	Misha	now	.	I	dont	want	you	to	come	with	me	.
JERRY	Oh	,	why	not	?
KATYA	It	has	been	three	days	since	our	night	together	.	Misha	said	that	was	all	the	time	I	needed	to	put	in	.
JERRY	Really	?
KATYA	In	my	country	,	they	speak	of	a	man	so	virile	,	so	potent	,	that	to	spend	a	night	with	such	a	man	is	to	enter	a	world	of	such	sensual	delights	most	women	dare	not	dream	of	.	This	man	is	known	as	the	Comedian	.	You	may	tell	jokes	,	Mr	.	Jerry	Seinfeld	,	but	you	are	no	Comedian	.
