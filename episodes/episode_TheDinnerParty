GEORGE	Maybe	its	not	even	stupidity	.	Maybe	its	just	a	blatant	disregard	for	basic	human	decency	.	If	this	how	dictators	start	.	Do	you	think	Mussolini	would	circle	the	block	six	times	looking	for	a	spot	?
KRAMER	How	about	Idi	Amin	?
GEORGE	Ill	tell	you	,	if	I	was	running	for	office	I	would	ask	for	the	death	penalty	for	double-parking	.	If	this	is	allowed	to	go	on	this	is	not	a	society	.	THIS	IS	ANARCHY	!
KRAMER	Are	those	shoes	comfortable	?
