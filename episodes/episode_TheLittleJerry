JERRY	So	what	happened	to	you	yesterday	?	We	were	supposed	to	go	to	the	auto	show	,	I	waited	for	you	,	you	never	came	.
ELAINE	Im	sorry	,	I	got	really	busy	.	How	long	did	you	wait	?
JERRY	Five	minutes	.
ELAINE	Five	minutes	?	Thats	it	?
JERRY	Whats	the	difference	?	You	never	showed	up	.
ELAINE	I	couldve	!	I	mean	,	last	week	we	waited	for	that	friend	of	Kramers	for	like	,	forty	minutes	.
JERRY	Well	,	we	barely	knew	the	guy	.
ELAINE	So	,	the	longer	you	know	someone	,	the	shorter	you	wait	for	em	.
JERRY	Thats	the	way	it	works	.
ELAINE	When	did	you	tell	George	to	be	here	?
JERRY	I	told	him	to	meet	us	here	in	ten	minutes	.	How	long	has	it	been	?
ELAINE	About	five	.
JERRY	Thats	enough	.	They	leave	.	George	comes	around	the	corner	.
KRAMER	So	,	I	noticed	you	bounced	a	check	at	the	bodega	.
JERRY	How	did	you	know	about	that	?
KRAMER	Because	Marcelino	,	he	taped	it	up	on	his	cash	register	with	all	the	other	bad	checks	.
JERRY	He	cant	do	that	.
GEORGE	Fantastic	day	!	Fantastic	!
JERRY	What	happened	?
GEORGE	Well	,	first	,	Im	brushing	my	teeth	and	this	piece	of	apple-skin	,	that	must	have	been	lodged	in	there	for	days	,	comes	loose	.
JERRY	Fantastic	.
GEORGE	Then	,	Im	at	The	Foundation	.		.		.
JERRY	Youre	still	doing	that	?
GEORGE	Sometimes	,	once	in	a	while	.
JERRY	When	you	feel	guilty	.
GEORGE	No	,	occasionally	Ill	forget	to	let	the	machine	pick	up	.	Anyway	,	they	made	this	large	donation	to	a	womens	prison	,	and	I	get	to	go	down	there	and	check	it	out	.
KRAMER	Thats	caged	heat	.
GEORGE	Yeah-hah	!
JERRY	What	are	you	gonna	do	there	?
GEORGE	Nothing	really	,	you	know	.		.		.	just	stroll	around	the	cell	blocks	,	maybe	take	in	a	shower	fight	.	Hey	,	you	know	you	got	a	bounced	check	hanging	up	in	the	little	market	over	on	Columbus	?
JERRY	Yes	,	I	know	,	I	know	.
GEORGE	I	noticed	you	chose	the	clowns	with	balloons	check	design	.
JERRY	It	was	a	mistake	,	the	bank	sent	me	the	wrong	ones	.
ELAINE	Hey	!	Look	whos	here	!	Hey	Kurt	,	this	is	Jerry	,	and	George	,	and	Kramer	.
KRAMER	Hey	,	Kurt	.	Taste	these	eggs	.
KURT	Uh	,	no	-	I	only	eat	cage-free	,	farm-fresh	.
KRAMER	Yes	!	These	are	sweatshop	eggs	.	Kramer	gets	up	to	leave	by	climbing	over	the	back	of	the	booth	.	He	loses	it	and	falls	on	the	floor	,	then	regains	his	composure	and	walks	out	with	his	napkin	still	tucked	in	his	collar	.
JERRY	Is	he	from	the	future	?
ELAINE	No	,	he	just	shaves	his	head	.	I	think	its	pretty	gutsy	.
GEORGE	Listen	,	sweetheart	,	let	me	tell	you	a	little	something	about	guts	.	Points	to	his	head	.		,	iThisi	,	is	guts	.
ELAINE	What	?	Clinging	to	some	scraps	?
GEORGE	These	are	not	scraps	.	These	are	historic	remains	of	a	once	great	society	of	hair	.
ELAINE	Oh	,	did	you	guys	stop	at	the	bodega	today	?	Some	moron	bounced	a	clown	check	!
JERRY	Again	,	Im	really	sorry	about	the	check	,	Marcelino	.
MARCELINO	People	seem	to	like	the	clowns	.
MARCELINO	Kay	.
MARCELINO	Sorry	,	no	.	Its	store	policy	.
JERRY	But	its	your	bodega	.
MARCELINO	Even		,	iIi	,	am	not	above	the	policy	.
BETSY	Those	are	our	tennis	courts	.
GEORGE	Tennis	courts	?	What	about	the	yard	?	Where	do	they	have	the	gang	fights	?
BETSY	Theres	no	fights	here	,	Mr	.	Costanza	.	This	is	a	minimum	security	facility	.
GEORGE	Hmm	.	What	about	a	hole	?	You	ever	put	anybody	in	the	box	?
BETSY	No	.
BETSY	And	finally	,	the	library	,	which	has	just	been	refurbished	thanks	to	your	generous	donation	.	This	is	Celia	Morgan	,	our	librarian	.
CELIA	Nice	to	meet	you	.
BETSY	Ill	be	in	my	office	if	you	need	me	.
GEORGE	Thanks	,	Warden	.
CELIA	So	,	are	you	the	head	of	the	foundation	?
GEORGE	Well	,	lets	just	say	it	wouldnt	exist	without	me	.	Notices	another	person	in	the	library	dressed	the	same	as	Celia	.	So	uh	,	you	two	shop	at	the	same	store	?
CELIA	No	,	its	standard	issue	.
GEORGE	Oh	my	God	.		.		.	youre	in	jail	?	Celia	nods	.	That	is	so	cool	!
JERRY	You	asked	her	out	?
GEORGE	Well	.		.		.	not	out	.	Shes	in	prison	.
JERRY	How	could	you	ask	her	out	?
GEORGE	Why	not	?
JERRY	I	remember	when	you	wouldnt	date	that	girl	who	lived	in	Queens	because	you	didnt	want	to	go	over	the	bridge	!
GEORGE	That	was	different	!
JERRY	Ill	say	.
GEORGE	Jerry	,	I	like	being	with	her	.	Plus	,	I	know	where	she	is	all	the	time	.	I	have	relatively	no	competition	.	And	you	know	how	you	live	in	fear	of	the	pop-in	?
GEORGE	Yeah	,	no	pop-in	,	no	in	the	neighborhood	,	no	I	saw	your	light	was	on	.	And	the	best	part	is	,	if	things	go	really	well	.		.		.
JERRY	Conjugal	visit	?
KRAMER	Hey	.	Whats	up	?
JERRY	George	is	dating	a	convict	.
KRAMER	Oh	?	Whats	she	in	for	?
GEORGE	Embezzlement	.
JERRY	Yeah	,	sure	.	You	dont	even	have	a	fridge	,	do	you	?
KRAMER	Well	,	not	here	.	Goes	into	the	hallway	,	comes	back	in	with	a	huge	bag	of	chicken	feed	.
JERRY	Kramer	,	wait	a	minute	,	what	the	hell	is	that	?
KRAMER	Well	,	its	chicken	feed	.	Slams	the	bag	into	Jerrys	fridge	.
JERRY	I	sense	something	is	afoot	.
GEORGE	Allow	me	.	Why	?
KRAMER	Cage-free	,	farm-fresh	eggs	.
JERRY	Allow	me	.	What	are	you	,	an	idiot	?
KURT	Hold	it	,	hold	it	,	I	got	it	.	Catch	.	Tosses	his	wallet	to	Elaine	,	she	pays	the	delivery	guy	.
KURT	What	?
ELAINE	Your	hair	.	Its	so	thick	and	lustrous	.	I	mean	,	it	.		.		.	it	was	.
KURT	Well	,	it	still	is	.	I	shave	my	head	for	my	swim	team	.	I	just	liked	the	way	it	looked	,	so	I	kept	it	.
ELAINE	Are	you	saying	that	I	could	be	dating	this	hair	?	With	you	under	it	?	Kurt	shrugs	.
JERRY	Is	that	your	chicken	making	all	that	noise	?
KRAMER	Oh	,	Jerry	loves	the	morning	.
JERRY	Who	?
KRAMER	Little	Jerry	Seinfeld	.	I	named	my	chicken	after	you	.
JERRY	Thanks	,	thats	very	sweet	,	but	that	is		,	inoti	,	a	chicken	.
KRAMER	Of	course	it	is	.	I	picked	it	out	myself	.
JERRY	Well	,	you	picked	out	a	rooster	.
KRAMER	Well	,	that	would	explain	Little	Jerrys	poor	egg	production	.
CELIA	This	was	fun	.
GEORGE	Yeah	.	I	had	a	great	time	.
GUARD	Five	minutes	,	Mr	.	Costanza	.

GEORGE	I	did	.	Im	back	.	I	love	this	relationship	,	I	feel	so	liberated	!
JERRY	Having	her	in	jail	.

JERRY	Yeah	,	dating	a	convicted	felon	.	I	dont	know	how	you	missed	it	.
ELAINE	Here	.	Shows	Kurts	drivers	licence	to	Jerry	.	Take	a	look	at	that	.

ELAINE	Its	chestnut	with	auburn	highlights	!
JERRY	So	?
ELAINE	Youre	not	around	women	.	You	dont	know	how	important	a	mans	hair	is	.	They	both	look	at	George	,	who	is	reading	a	newspaper	and	struggling	to	keep	his	composure	.	Im	sorry	,	George	,	but	its	true	.
MARCELINO	Hey	,	Kramer	.	Nice	rooster	.	Whats	his	name	?

He	didnt	even	have	to	touch	him	!	The	other	rooster	ran	out	of	the	ring	.	The	whole	fight	lasted	two	seconds	.

KURT	Happy	?	Why	should	I	be	happy	?
GEORGE	Youve	still	got	pretty	good	coverage	.	Once	the	enemy	advances	beyond	this	perimeter	-	points	at	Kurts	head	with	a	pen	-	then	you	wont	be	Kurt	anymore	.
KURT	Who	will	I	be	?
KURT	How	long	do	I	have	?

ELAINE	Why	did	you	get	into	a	fist	fight	with	the	cop	?	You	were	innocent	!
KURT	They	thought	I	was	George	.	Im	not	that	bald	.	I	have	too	little	time	left	to	take	that	kind	of	crap	,	so	I	slugged	him	.
ELAINE	So	,	how	long	are	you	gonna	be	in	here	for	?
KURT	Well	,	my	lawyer	says	months	,	but	with	good	behavior	,	maybe	.		.		.		?
ELAINE	So	,	to	months	.
KURT	Yeah	.
