GINA	You	know	why	he	did	this	?	Because	I	told	him	it	was	over	.	I	did	not	want	to	see	him	anymore	.
JERRY	Really	?	Its	over	?

JERRY	Of	course	.
GINA	Tell	me	everything	.
JERRY	Are	you	sure	he	cant	hear	anything	?		.		.		.	MARTIN	,	MARTIN	.
GINA	I	wish	he	was	not	in	a	coma	.	I	wish	he	was	dead	.	I	wish	I	could	pull	the	plug	out	from	him	.
JERRY	I	,	would	,	I	would	wait	on	that	.	I	know	how	you	feel	but	.	Juries	today	,	you	never	know	how	theyre	going	to	look	at	a	thing	like	this	.
GINA	I	saw	you	looking	at	your	watch	.	You	want	to	leave	?	Go	ahead	.

JERRY	No	,	no	,	I	want	to	.	I	,	I	very	much	want	to	.	I	,	I	desire	to	.	I	,	I	pine	to	.
GINA	Then	kiss	me	right	in	front	of	him	.
JERRY	I	cant	.	What	if	he	wakes	up	?
GINA	A	man	is	lying	here	unconscious	and	youre	afraid	of	him	?	What	kind	of	a	man	are	you	?
JERRY	A	man	who	respects	a	good	comma	.	If	it	was	one	of	those	in	and	out	comas	,	maybe	.	But	when	a	guys	got	a	coma	going	like	this	you	dont	want	to	mess	with	it	.
KRAMER	Hey	.
JERRY	Hey	.
KRAMER	Did	you	hear	about	Martin	?
JERRY	Yeah	,	I	heard	.
KRAMER	I	cant	believe	hes	in	a	coma	.
KRAMER	Hes	got	my	vacuum	cleaner	.	You	know	I	loaned	it	to	him	.	He	never	returned	it	.	The	carpets	are	filthy	.	What	am	I	going	to	do	?
JERRY	Who	told	you	about	Martin	?
KRAMER	Newman	!	Hes	good	friends	with	him	.
KRAMER	Hes	got	all	of	my	attachments	,	you	know	.
JERRY	Hey	,	let	me	ask	you	something	.	How	long	do	you	have	to	wait	for	a	guy	to	come	out	of	a	coma	before	you	can	ask	his	ex-girlfriend	out	?
KRAMER	What	,	Gina	?	Why	wait	?	Why	not	just	call	Doctor	Kavorkian	?
JERRY	You	know	I	dont	get	that	whole	suicide	machine	.	Theres	no	tall	buildings	where	these	people	live	?	They	cant	wrap	their	lips	around	a	revolver	like	a	normal	person	?
KRAMER	So	whats	going	on	between	you	and	Gina	?

KRAMER	Uh	,	uh	,	you	see	thats	the	great	thing	about	Mediterranean	women	.	All	right	,	so	what	did	you	do	?
JERRY	Nothing	.
KRAMER	Ah	,	what	kind	of	a	man	are	you	?	The	guy	is	unconscious	in	a	coma	and	you	dont	have	the	guts	to	kiss	his	girlfriend	?
JERRY	I	didnt	know	what	the	coma	etiquette	was	.
KRAMER	There	is	no	coma	etiquette	.	You	see	thats	the	beauty	of	the	coma	,	man	.	It	doesnt	matter	what	you	do	around	it	.
JERRY	So	youre	saying	,	his	girl	,	his	car	,	his	clothes	,	its	all	up	for	grabs	.	You	can	just	loot	the	coma	victim	.
KRAMER	Id	give	him	hours	to	get	out	of	it	.	They	cant	get	out	of	it	in	hours	,	its	a	land	rush	.
JERRY	So	if	the	coma	victim	wakes	up	in	a	month	,	hes	thrilled	,	he	got	out	of	the	coma	.	He	goes	home	,	theres	nothing	left	?
KRAMER	NOTHING	LEFT	!	Thats	why	Im	trying	to	get	that	vacuum	cleaner	.	Because	somebodys	going	to	grab	it	.
RULA	Martins	spirit	came	to	you	as	a	warning	.
ELAINE	Why	would	he	come	to	George	?
RULA	Because	George	has	heightened	extra	sensory	perception	.	FAYGY	GET	YOUR	FINGER	OUT	OF	YOUR	NOSE	.
GEORGE	I	knew	it	.	I	always	felt	different	.

GEORGE	Pauline	?		.		.		.	Wait	a	minute	.	I	got	it	.	My	brother	once	impregnated	a	woman	named	Pauline	.
RULA	Do	you	think	about	her	?
GEORGE	When	I	hear	her	name	mentioned	.
RULA	Cut	these	with	your	left	hand	.
GEORGE	There	was	a	woman	,	Audrey	.	She	had	a	very	big	nose	.
RULA	I	see	an	Audrey	,	but	with	a	small	nose	.
GEORGE	Yes	,	yes	,	she	had	a	nose	job	.	I	loved	her	very	deeply	.	Will	she	ever	speak	to	me	again	?
RULA	Not	in	this	life	.

GEORGE	Elaine	,	shes	a	psychic	.	She	knows	how	the	kids	going	to	be	.

RULA	George	,	I	am	going	to	tell	you	something	and	I	want	you	to	really	hear	me	.
ELAINE	Now	listen	.	I	just	dont	know	how	a	person	,	with	everything	we	now	know	about	pre-natal	care	can	put	a	cigarette	in	her	mouth	.
GEORGE	Elaine	,	what	are	you	doing	?
ELAINE	Its	disgusting	.
RULA	I	DONT	BELIVE	IT	.	I	would	like	you	both	to	leave	.
ELAINE	Oh	fine	,	I	dont	like	to	be	around	people	who	are	just	so	irresponsible	.
RULA	Get	the	hell	out	.
GEORGE	A	plane	crash	?	A	Heart	attack	?	Lupus	?	Is	it	Lupus	?
RULA	Do	you	want	me	to	call	the	super	?	He	was	an	Israeli	commando	.
GEORGE	If	you	dont	say	anything	I	will	assume	its	a	plane	crash	.
RULA	Get	out	.
GEORGE	Not	a	plane	crash	.	Is	it	a	plane	crash	?
GINA	I	do	not	like	your	toothbrush	.	There	are	no	bristles	.
JERRY	You	can	say	what	you	want	about	me	but	Ill	be	damned	if	Im	going	to	stand	here	while	you	insult	my	toothbrush	.
GINA	It	is	too	small	for	someone	with	such	a	big	mouth		.	Let	me	ask	you	.	What	will	you	do	if	Martine	wakes	up	?	Run	away	like	a	mouse	?
JERRY	No	,	more	like	the	Three	Stooges	at	the	end	of	every	movie	.
GINA	Who	are	these	Stooges	you	speak	of	?
JERRY	Theyre	a	comedy	team	.
GINA	Tell	me	about	them	.	Everything	.
JERRY	Well	,	theyre	three	kind	of	funny	looking	guys	and	they	hit	each	other	a	lot	.
GINA	You	will	show	me	The	Stooges	?
JERRY	I	will	show	you	The	Stooges	.
GINA	When	?
JERRY	Well	,	I	dont	really	know	where	The	Stooges	are	right	now	but	if	I	locate	them	you	will	be	the	first	to	know	.
GINA	Come	,	you	walk	me	to	a	cab	.
JERRY	Well	,	uh	,	I	uh	,	I	dont	want	you	to	get	upset	or	anything	but	uh	,	with	Martin	and	all	,	well	maybe	its	not	such	a	good	idea	for	us	to	be	seen	together	in	the	building	,	because	,	you	know	,	he	had	a	lot	of	friends	here	.
GINA	Youre	still	afraid	.	You	are	not	a	man	.
JERRY	Well	then	what	are	all	those	ties	and	sport	jackets	doing	in	my	closet	?

ELAINE	Did	you	see	that	wall	move	?
JERRY	Boy	,	its	a	good	thing	we	came	.
