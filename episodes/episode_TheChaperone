GEORGE	What	if	she	becomes	Miss	America	?	You	could	be	dating	Miss	America	,	Jerry	!
JERRY	The	only	bad	thing	is	,	we	have	to	go	out	with	a	chaperone	.
GEORGE	Chaperone	?	What	,	are	you	kidding	?
JERRY	No	,	its	part	of	the	contest	rules	.

GEORGE	Why	shouldnt	I	?
LANDIS	Of	course	,	Jackie	O	.	was	a	great	lady	.	Those	are	going	to	be	some	tough	shoes	to	fill	.	Everyone	loved	her	.	She	had	such	.		.		.	grace	.
LANDIS	Not	many	people	have	grace	.
ELAINE	Well	,	you	know	,	grace	is	a	tough	one	.	I	like	to	think	I	have	a	little	grace	.		.		.	not	as	much	as	Jackie	-
LANDIS	You	cant	have	a	little	grace	.	You	either	have	grace	,	or	you	.		.		.	dont	.
ELAINE	O	.	K	.		,	fine	,	I	have	.		.		.	no	grace	.
LANDIS	And	you	cant	acquire	grace	.
ELAINE	Well	,	I	have	no	intention	of	getting	grace	.

LANDIS	Excuse	me	?
ELAINE	Nothing	.	Mr	.	Pitt	comes	in	with	some	papers	in	hand	.
PITT	Mrs	.	Landis	,	theres	something	wrong	with	this	copying	machine	,	its	all	coming	out	slanted	.	Now	,	I	dont	know	if	this	is	your	department	or	not	.
LANDIS	Justin	Pitt	,	this	is	Elaine	Benes	.	Elaine	turns	around	.	With	sunglasses	and	a	scarf	on	her	head	,	she	bears	a	close	resemblance	to	Jackie	O	.
ELAINE	I	was	a	great	admirer	of	Mrs	.	Onass-sis-sis-sis	.		.		.
JERRY	Hello	,	Karen	?	Its	Jerry	Seinfeld	.	Oh	,	thats	very	sweet	of	you	.	You	know	,	you	better	be	careful	,	you	dont	want	to	get	too	congenial	.

KRAMER	Nothin	.
JERRY	Im	going	out	with	one	of	the	Miss	America	contestants	,	you	wanna	go	?
KRAMER	What	state	?
JERRY	Rhode	Island	.
KRAMER	Theyre	never	in	contention	.
GEORGE	How	do	you	know	?
KRAMER	Because	Ive	seen	every	Miss	America	pageant	since	I	was	six	.
JERRY	Look	,	do	you	want	to	go	or	not	?	Ill	buy	you	dinner	.
KRAMER	Giddy-up	!
ELAINE	Well	,	a	lot	of	people	have	brown	eyes	.

PITT	Some	grace	,	yes	.
ELAINE	Just	some	?
PITT	Well	,	you	dont	want	too	much	grace	or	you	wont	be	able	to	stand	.
PITT	Elaine	,	I	want	you	to	come	and	work	for	me	as	my	personal	assistant	.		,	BeginAd		,	EndAd		,	Now	,	Ill	pay	you	the	same	as	Pendant	,	but	I	would	need	you	to	start	right	away	.
GEORGE	Hey	,	Buck	.	Talk	to	you	for	a	second	?
SHOWALTER	Sure	,	George	.
GEORGE	Hows	everything	going	?	Everything	O	.	K	.		?
SHOWALTER	Well	,	all	of	a	sudden	theres	a	problem	with	Tartabulls	swing	.		.		.
GEORGE	Listen	,	Buck	,	I	uh	.		.		.	obviously	I	dont	need	to	talk	to	you	about	the	importance	of	player	morale	,	but	uh	.		.		.	Ive	been	talking	to	some	of	the	guys	,	and	some	of	them	-	I	dont	want	to	mention	any	names	-	but	some	of	them	.		.		.	theyre	not	too	happy	with	the	polyester	uniforms	.
SHOWALTER	How	so	?
GEORGE	Well	,	they	get	very	hot	in	the	polyester	.	You	know	,	its	not	a	natural	fibre	.	I	think	they	would	prefer	cotton	.
SHOWALTER	Cotton	,	huh	?
GEORGE	Yeah	.	Cotton	breathes	,	you	see	,	its	much	softer	.	Imagine	playing	games	and	your	team	is	five	degrees	cooler	than	the	other	team	.	Dont	you	think	that	would	be	an	advantage	?	Theyre	cooler	,	theyre	more	comfortable	.		.		.	theyre	happier	-	theyre	gonna	play	better	.
SHOWALTER	You	may	have	something	there	,	George	.
GEORGE	Oh	-	Ive	got	something	.
JERRY	Congratulations	!
ELAINE	Yeah	!	And	the	best	part	is	,	I	still	get	to	look	for	work	in	publishing	.
JERRY	Now	,	what	is	it	that	you	do	,	exactly	?
ELAINE	I	attend	to	his	personal	affairs	.
JERRY	Like	what	?
ELAINE	Well	,	like	tomorrow	for	example	,	I	have	to	uh	.		.		.	I	have	to	buy	him	some	socks	.
JERRY	Really	!	Socks	!
ELAINE	Yeah	.	White	ones	.	Like	the	ones	you	wear	with	sneakers	.
JERRY	Hey	,	maybe	you	can	pick	me	up	some	underwear	!	Kramer	enters	.
JERRY	Listen	.		.		.	tonight	,	after	we	finish	eating	,	you	make	like	you	got	something	else	to	do	and	just	recede	into	the	night	,	if	you	know	what	I	mean	.
KRAMER	No	way	!
JERRY	What	?
KRAMER	Look	,	if	you	think	Im	just	going	to	step	aside	and	do	nothing	while	you	defile	this	woman	,	youre	crazy	.
JERRY	Im	not	going	to	defile	her	!
KRAMER	Thats	right	,	because	Im	going	to	see	it	doesnt	happen	.	Look	,	Jerry	,	these	girls	are	Miss	America	contestants	.	Its	every	little	girls	dream	.	And	Im	not	going	to	let	you	trample	that	dream	and	make	a	mockery	of	everything	the	pageant	stands	for	.
JERRY	But	-
JERRY	But	wait	a	minute	.		.		.
KRAMER	Now	,	if	you	want	to	go	out	and	have	some	good	,	wholesome	fun	with	a	nice	girl	,	Id	be	glad	to	help	you	out	.		.		.	if	youre	looking	for	something	more	than	that	,	youve	got	the	wrong	guy	,	buddy	!	Jerry	tries	to	get	a	word	in	during	this	entire	speech	,	but	Kramer	wont	budge	an	inch	.
KRAMER	If	you	were	Miss	America	,	what	would	you	do	to	make	the	world	a	better	place	?
KAREN	As	Miss	America	,	I	would	try	and	bring	an	end	to	world	hunger	.	If	every	person	sacrificed	one	meal	a	week	,	there	would	be	enough	to	feed	the	whole	world	!
JERRY	Thats	a	hell	of	a	plan	.	Listen	-
JERRY	Alright	,	Kramer	!
KRAMER	This	is	important	stuff	!	Shes	got	to	be	able	to	answer	these	questions	.	Shes	not	going	to	have	time	to	think	,	out	there	,	with	millions	of	people	watching	her	.	Any	hesitation	could	cost	her	the	crown	.	You	know	,	poise	counts	.
KAREN	You	really	know	a	lot	about	this	,	dont	you	?
KRAMER	Oh	yeah	,	like	last	year	?	Miss	Texas	?	Now	,	she	should	have	won	easily	,	but	she	lost	points	in	the	swimsuit	competition	.
KAREN	Well	,	what	could	she	have	done	?
KRAMER	Tape	her	breasts	together	.	Jerry	is	shocked	.
KAREN	What	else	?
KRAMER	Well	,	take	you	for	example	.	Now	,	youre	very	attractive	,	but	you	got	a	big	waist	.
JERRY	Hey	,	come	on	!
KAREN	No	,	no	.		.		.	its	O	.	K	.	Go	on	.
KRAMER	Well	,	Id	recommend	a	waist	cincher	.
KAREN	Really	.
KRAMER	Oh	,	yeah	.	Just	-		,	ithip	!	i	,	-	suck	you	in	.
JERRY	Ill	be	right	back	.	Leaves	the	table	.
KRAMER	So	,	whats	your	talent	?
KAREN	Magic	.
KRAMER	Mmm	.	Im	thinking	of	a	number	from	one	to	ten	.
KAREN	Six	.
KRAMER	No	,	five	.	But	you	were	close	.
KRAMER	Hows	your	evening	?
KAREN	Well	,	Im	wearing	this	red	dress	-
KRAMER	Stop	right	there	.
KAREN	No	good	?
KRAMER	Disaster	.
KAREN	Why	?
KRAMER	Well	,	you	got	brown	eyes	.	You	want	to	wear	a	green	dress	.
KAREN	That	makes	sense	.	The	limo	stops	at	Karens	hotel	.
JERRY	Well	,	here	we	are	.		.		.
KAREN	Kramer	,	would	you	consider	being	my	personal	consultant	for	the	pageant	?
KRAMER	Okay	.	But	if	Im	going	to	do	this	,	we	play	by	my	rules	or	we	dont	play	at	all	.
KAREN	I	am	in	your	hands	.	They	shake	hands	.	Well	!	Oh	,	good	night	,	Jerry	.	Theyre	about	to	kiss	,	but	Kramer	stops	them	by	clearing	his	throat	.	Kenneth	will	take	you	home	.	She	gets	out	,	leaving	Jerry	staring	at	Kramer	with	an	angry	expression	on	his	face	.
"Scene ends with an exterior shot of the limo going down the street.         We hear Kramer singing the Miss America theme song, and Jerry telling         him to ""shut the f*ck up.""&gt;</p>"
KRAMER	Hey	.
JERRY	Well	,	if	it	isnt	Mr	.	Blackwell	.

KRAMER	No	.	Alright	,	watch	me	now	.	Karen	sits	on	the	bed	.	Kramer	walks	across	the	room	like	a	Miss	America	contestant	with	a	big	smile	on	his	face	.	Turn	,	back	,	head	up	,	shoulders	back	.		.		.	posture	.	You	see	?	Posture	.
KAREN	Yes	,	I	see	.	O	.	K	.

KAREN	Kramer	,	are	these	questions	really	that	important	.		.		.		?
KRAMER	Yes	,	theyre	important	!	If	you	stumble	,	if	you	hesitate	,	you	can	kiss	the	crown	goodbye	.	Now	if	Ive	told	you	once	,	Ive	told	you	a	thousand	times	-	poise	counts	!	Its	just	as	important	as	the	others	.	Swimsuit	!		,	BeginAd		,	EndAd		,	Evening	wear	!	Talent	!	POISE	!

PITT	Its	good	,	but	.		.		.
ELAINE	But	what	?		?
PITT	Ultimately	I	dont	think	theyll	stay	up	.

ELAINE	But	thats	why	I	got	you	the	tighter	ones	!	Holds	them	up	.
PITT	Oh	,	forget	about	those	!	Takes	the	socks	from	Elaine	and	throws	them	on	the	floor	.	Why	do	you	keep	mentioning	those	?
ELAINE	What	do	you	want	!		?
PITT	I	want	a	decent	sock	thats	comfortable	,	that	will	stay	on	my	foot	!		!
JERRY	What	the	hell	is	that	?
GEORGE	I	dont	know	,	it	sounds	like	pigeons	or	something	!
GEORGE	Me	either	.	Is	there	anything	you	can	do	to	shut	them	up	?
JERRY	Wait	a	second	.	Grabs	the	icebucket	off	the	counter	.	Thisll	scare	em	off	.	Dumps	the	bucket	of	water	over	the	balcony	.	We	hear	a	loud	squawking	noise	and	the	flapping	of	wings	,	then	the	noise	is	gone	.	Jerry	gets	back	into	bed	.	Well	,	good	night	,	Ollie	.
GEORGE	Good	night	,	Stan	.
KRAMER	What	is	it	?
KAREN	My	doves	!	Theyre	dead	!	I	trained	those	birds	for	eight	years	!	How	am	I	supposed	to	do	my	magic	act	now	?
KRAMER	How	did	this	happen	?
KAREN	They	like	it	outside	,	so	I	kept	them	in	a	cage	on	the	terrace	.		.		.	then	I	found	them	dead	in	a	pool	of	water	!
KAREN	It	must	have	been	an	accident	.
KRAMER	Accident	?	This	was	no	accident	.	These	doves	were	murdered	.
KRAMER	Well	,	thats	it	!	Shes	out	of	the	pageant	!
JERRY	What	?	Why	?	What	happened	?
KRAMER	Her	birds	are	dead	.
JERRY	Birds	?
KRAMER	Yeah	,	birds	.	Shes	got	these	trained	doves	,	she	does	this	magic	act	,	that	was	her	talent	for	the	pageant	.	You	know	what	I	think	,	Jerry	?	I	think	somebody	murdered	those	doves	.	Somebody	wanted	her	out	of	that	contest	bad	.	Somebody	who	was	just	eaten	up	with	jealousy	.	Somebody	who	just	couldnt	stand	to	have	the	spotlight	taken	off	of	them	!	Kramer	turns	around	and	notices	the	empty	icebucket	on	the	edge	of	Jerrys	balcony	.
JERRY	What	are	you	looking	at	?	Kramer	goes	out	onto	the	terrace	and	looks	down	.	Oh	,	that	!	We	had	to	leave	that	outside	,	last	night	,	because	the	water	was	making	the	room	too	cold	.
JERRY	No	,	you	dont	understand	-	its	not	what	you	think	!	It	was	an	accident	!
KRAMER	Well	,	dont	think	youve	won	,	because	you	havent	!	This	kid	is	a	fighter	!	And	if	you	think	Im	gonna	let	a	couple	of	dead	birds	get	in	our	way	,	youre	crazy	!
JERRY	Kramer	,	you	gotta	explain	to	her	what	happened	.		.		.		!	Kramer	exits	.
JERRY	Oh	,	it	was	just	Kramer	.		.		.	apparently	I	killed	Miss	Rhode	Islands	doves	with	a	bucket	of	water	last	night	.
GEORGE	Oh	.	Goes	back	into	the	bathroom	.
KAREN	O	.	K	.		,	this	is	it	!
KRAMER	How	ya	feelin	?
