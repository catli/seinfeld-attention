Better	food	,	better	view	,	better	TV	.	And	cleaner	?	Oh	-	much	cleaner	.	That	became	my	reality	.	I	ignored	the	squalor	in	my	own	life	because	Im	looking	at	life	,	you	see	,	through	Jerrys	eyes	.	I	was	living	in	twilight	,	George	.	Living	in	the	shadows	.	Living	in	the	darkness	.		.		.	like	you	.

KRAMER	I	yearn	.
GEORGE	You	yearn	.
KRAMER	Oh	,	yes	.	Yes	,	I	yearn	.	Often	,	I	.		.		.	I	sit	.		.		.	and	yearn	.	Have	you	yearned	?
GEORGE	Well	,	not	recently	.	I	craved	.	I	crave	all	the	time	,	constant	craving	.		.		.	but	I	havent	yearned	.

KRAMER	No	,	the	acting	bug	.	Ever	since	I	was	in	that	Woody	Allen	movie	.
GEORGE	These	pretzels	are	making	me	thirsty	?	That	was	one	line	!	You	got	fired	!
KRAMER	I	know	,	I	know	,	but	man	!	I	never	felt	so	alive	!	Now	,	are	you	coming	with	me	?
GEORGE	Uh	,	no	,	Im	not	.
KRAMER	Alright	,	suit	yourself	.	But	lets	keep	this	between	us	-	were	key	brothers	now	.	Gets	up	to	leave	.
GEORGE	Youre	not	really	gonna	go	to	California	,	are	you	?
GEORGE	Anyway	,	so	he	gave	me	his	spare	keys	,	now	he	wants	to	have	my	keys	,	so	I	need	mine	back	from	you	.
ELAINE	Just	cause	you	have	his	keys	?	Why	does	he	need	yours	?

GEORGE	Well	,	I	dont	see	why	if	you	have	his	,	he	should	have	yours	.
ELAINE	I	just	said	the	same	thing	to	you	.
GEORGE	What	?
ELAINE	What	?
GEORGE	Alright	,	listen	,	Ill	give	you	your	spare	keys	,	but	I	dont	have	them	with	me	.	Can	I	please	have	mine	to	give	to	back	to	Kramer	?
ELAINE	Yeah	,	O	.	K	.	Ill	go	get	em	.	George	begins	to	leaf	through	papers	on	Elaines	counter	.	What	are	you	doing	?	Would	you	just	put	that	down	?	Takes	the	papers	away	from	George	.	I	gotta	get	some	new	friends	.
JERRY	Did	you	bring	the	keys	?
GEORGE	Yes	,	but	I	still	dont	feel	right	about	letting	you	into	Kramers	apartment	without	his	permission	.
JERRY	This	could	be	an	emergency	!
GEORGE	You	never	should	have	taken	away	his	keys	!
JERRY	I	tried	to	give	em	back	,	he	wouldnt	take	em	.	Jerry	and	George	go	out	into	the	hallway	to	Kramers	apartment	.

ELAINE	Yeah	,	yeah	,	I	saw	it	.	mutters	under	her	breath	I	mean	,	its	complete	bullsht	.

JERRY	No	,	whatd	you	say	?
ELAINE	Nothing	.	I	didnt	say	anything	.
JERRY	Oh	,	you	didnt	see	it	.
ELAINE	Yeah	,	I	saw	it	.	I	saw	it	!	I	did	,	I	saw	it	.	Yep	.
JERRY	I	heard	you	say	something	,	there	.
ELAINE	I	didnt	say	anything	.
JERRY	Im	calling	Kramers	mother	.	Picks	up	the	phone	,	dials	.	I	dont	know	what	you	said	.	But	it	was	something	.	I	heard	something	.	Hello	?	Hello	,	Mrs	.	Kramer	?	Mrs	.	Kramer	?	Could	you	turn	the	music	down	?	Could	you	turn	the	music	down	!
GEORGE	Ask	her	about	Kramer	.
JERRY	Shes	drunk	out	of	her	mind	.
BIKER	About	five	years	ago	.	I	was	going	down	this	very	road	.	Same	time	of	day	,	going	about	the	same	speed	Im	going	now	.		.		.	there	was	a	rock	in	the	road	.	Couldnt	have	been	more	than	a	pebble	.	Never	really	saw	it	!	Lost	control	of	the	bike	,	went	flyin	about	a	hundred	feet	-	came	down	right	on	my	head	.	Cracked	it	wide	open	!	Blood	and	stuff	was	just	splattered	all	over	the	road	,	there	.		.		.	I	broke	every	bone	in	my	face	.	Hey	,	you	know	,	when	they	found	me	,	my	eyes	were	hanging	out	of	their	sockets	?	Yeah	,	they	pronounced	me	dead	at	the	scene	.	I	was	in	a	coma	for	.		.		.	well	,	they	told	me	about	a	year	.		.		.	said	Id	be	a	vegetable	for	life	.	Yeah	,	but	I	showed	em	.	Ever	since	then	I	always	wear	a	helmet	!	The	biker	goes	into	a	turn	.	Lean	!	Kramer	yells	.
GEORGE	Look	,	I	gotta	tell	ya	.		.		.	I	been	thinkin	about	it	,	I	just	dont	feel	right	about	letting	you	into	Elaines	apartment	.
JERRY	Dont	feel	right	?	What	are	you	talking	about	?
GEORGE	Well	,	you	know	,	I	shouldnt	have	let	you	into	Kramers	,	now	you	want	to	go	into	Elaines	.		.		.	she	entrusted	me	with	her	spare	keys	,	how	can	I	just	let	you	in	?
JERRY	What	is	the	big	deal	?
GEORGE	Just	because	you	have	someones	spare	keys	,	it	doesnt	entitle	you	to	break	into	their	apartment	.	Thats	the	reason	you	took	away	Kramers	keys	.
JERRY	First	of	all	,	youre	not	even	supposed	to	have	Elaines	keys	.	Youre	supposed	to	give	em	back	to	her	,	so	she	can	give	em	back	to	me	,	because	she	has	mine	.	So	technically	,	those	are	my	keys	.
GEORGE	Yes	,	well	,	if	you	had	never	taken	your	keys	back	from	Kramer	,	he	never	would	have	taken	his	back	from	you	and	given	em	to	me	,	in	which	case	I	wouldnt	have	had	to	take	mine	back	from	her	.
JERRY	Well	,	I	want	those	keys	.	Tries	to	grab	the	keys	from	George	.
GEORGE	Nope	,	no	can	do	.
JERRY	George	,	give	them	to	me	,	I	want	these	keys	.	They	struggle	over	the	keys	.	I	dont	want	to	get	physical	!
GEORGE	Do	you	wanna	fight	?
JERRY	Do	you	wanna	fight	?
GEORGE	Ill	fight	ya	!	Not	the	face	!	Not	the	face	!	The	struggle	continues	.
KRAMER	And	then	,	the	evil	ogre	took	back	the	magical	keys	from	the	handsome	young	prince	.
KRAMER	Yes	!	And	then	the	handsome	young	prince	was	cast	out	into	the	cruel	,	cruel	world	.
KRAMER	Oh	,	hes	cold	.
KRAMER	Yeah	,	yeah	.		.		.	thatd	be	funny	.	Hey	,	you	can	drop	me	here	!
KRAMER	Well	,	you	know	,	I	gotta	be	goin	now	.
KRAMER	What	do	you	think	,	junior	?	You	think	these	hands	have	been	soakin	in	Ivory	liquid	?	mimics	choking
Scene ends with Kramer trying to escape their         clutches.&gt;</p>
JERRY	Dont	you	see	?	Youre	just	avoiding	the	middle	man	.	You	were	gonna	give	her	her	spare	keys	,	so	she	was	gonna	give	em	to	me	.	So	,	all	thats	happening	is	that	instead	of	giving	them	to	her	,	youre	giving	them	to	me	.	Its	just	unfortunate	that	when	she	gave	you	yours	,	you	didnt	give	her	hers	.	Cause	then	she	would	have	given	em	to	me	,	because	she	has	mine	.	So	then	I	would	have	never	had	to	ask	you	for	hers	,	so	that	I	could	get	mine	.
GEORGE	Youre	right	,	how	did	I	miss	that	?	Begins	unlocking	the	door	,	mutters	under	his	breath	Maybe	because	its	a	crock	of	sht	.
JERRY	Whats	that	?
GEORGE	Nothing	.
JERRY	I	heard	something	.
GEORGE	Didnt	say	anything	.
KRAMER	So	,	how	long	you	been	drivin	this	thing	?
WOMAN	Goin	on	four	years	.
KRAMER	Well	,	nothins	sexier	than	a	woman	behind	the	wheel	of	a	semi	.
WOMAN	Nothin	?	Listen	to	you	,	youre	quite	the	sweet-talker	.
KRAMER	You	know	,	I	always	wanted	to	drive	the	big	rigs	.	I	used	to	watch	those	commercials	during	the	reruns	of	Gomer	Pyle	.
WOMAN	You	want	to	give	it	a	try	?
KRAMER	Really	?
WOMAN	Do	you	know	how	to	double-clutch	?
KRAMER	Yeah	.
WOMAN	Well	,	come	on	!	They	trade	places	and	Kramer	gets	behind	the	wheel	.	Kramer	turns	out	to	be	really	rusty	on	the	ol	double-clutch	.
GEORGE	They	were	in	here	,	I	saw	her	put	em	in	here	!
JERRY	Well	,	this	is	great	.
GEORGE	Well	,	what	do	they	look	like	?
JERRY	They	look	like	keys	,	George	.	They	look	exactly	like	keys	.	What	do	they	look	like	.
GEORGE	Well	,	theyre	obviously	not	here	.
JERRY	Well	,	theyve	gotta	be	here	somewhere	.

JERRY	Is	that	something	you	want	to	do	?
ELAINE	I	dont	know	.	Those	writers	make	a	lot	of	money	.
JERRY	Elaine	,	let	me	tell	you	something	about	show	business	.	Its	hard	work	!	You	dont	just	write	a	Murphy	Brown	.	You	gotta	watch	the	show	,	study	it	,	get	a	sense	of	the	characters	,	how	they	relate	to	each	other	.
ELAINE	O	.	K	.		,	can	I	just	watch	the	show	?	mutters	under	her	breath	God	,	what	an	asshole	.
