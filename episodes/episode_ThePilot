JERRY	To	me	,
JERRY	To	me	,	the	whole	concept	of	fear	of	success	is	proof	that	we	are	definitely	scraping	the	bottom	of	the	fear	barrel	.	Are	we	gonna	have	to	have	AA-type	meetings	for	these	people	?	Theyll	go	Hi	,	my	name	is	Bill	,	and	the	one	thing	Im	worried	about	is	to	have	a	stereo	and	a	cream-colored	couch	.	According	to	most	studies	,	peoples	number-one	fear	is	public	speaking	.	Number	two	is	death	.	Death	is	number	two	!	Now	,	this	means	to	the	average	person	,	if	you	have	to	go	to	a	funeral	,	youre	better	off	in	the	casket	than	doing	the	eulogy	.
KRAMER	Why	cant	I	play	Kramer	?
JERRY	Look	weve	been	through	this	already	.	Youre	not	an	actor	!
KRAMER	Neither	are	you	.
JERRY	I	know	.	So	why	do	we	need	two	people	in	the	show	that	cant	act	?
KRAMER	Oh	come	on	Jerry	.	How	hard	is	it	to	act	.	You	say	something	,	Ill	pretend	its	funny	.
JERRY	My	grandmothers	in	the	hospital	.
KRAMER	Ha	ha	ha	.	Your	grandmothers	in	the	hospital	!
JERRY	This	is	real	believable	.
KRAMER	What	you	didnt	think	I	was	really	laughing	?
JERRY	It	stinks	.
KRAMER	Let	me	see	you	do	it	.

KRAMER	Alright	.	Ive	never	been	to	Mars	but	I	imagine	its	quite	lovely	.

DOCTOR	Well	I	dont	know	what	it	is	.
GEORGE	A	biopsy	!
JERRY	What	did	he	say	?
GEORGE	He	said	he	didnt	know	what	it	was	.
JERRY	Alright	.	So	?
GEORGE	When	I	asked	him	if	it	was	cancer	,	he	didnt	give	me	a	get	outta	here	.	Thats	what	I	wanted	to	hear	Cancer	?	Get	outta	here	?
JERRY	Well	,	maybe	he	doesnt	have	a	get	outta	here	kind	of	personality	.
GEORGE	How	could	you	be	a	doctor	and	not	say	get	outta	here	?	It	should	be	part	of	the	training	at	medical	school	Cancer	?	Get	outta	here	!	Go	home	!	What	are	you	crazy	?	Its	a	little	test	.	Its	nothing	.	Youre	a	real	nut	.	You	know	that	?	I	told	you	that	God	would	never	let	me	be	successful	.	I	never	shouldve	written	that	pilot	.	Now	the	show	will	be	a	big	hit	,	well	make	millions	of	dollars	,	and	Ill	be	dead	.	Dead	Jerry	.	Because	of	this	.
JERRY	Cant	you	at	least	die	with	a	little	dignity	?
GEORGE	No	I	cant	.	I	cant	die	with	dignity	.	I	have	no	dignity	.	I	want	to	be	the	one	person	who	doesnt	die	with	dignity	.	I	live	my	whole	life	in	shame	.	Why	should	I	die	with	dignity	?
JERRY	Hey	.	What	happened	to	you	yesterday	?
KRAMER	I	got	mugged	.
GEORGE	You	got	mugged	?
JERRY	Mugged	?
KRAMER	Well	,	I	wouldnt	have	minded	it	so	much	but	I	was	running	home	to	go	to	the	bathroom	.
JERRY	Why	didnt	you	use	the	bathroom	in	the	building	?
KRAMER	It	was	full	.	I	tried	a	few	other	places	,	you	know	,	but	that	didnt	work	.	I	mean	it	was	an	emergency	Jerrry	.	I	was	really	percolating	.		.		.	So	I	decided	to	run	home	through	the	park	and	then	these	two	guys	they	stopped	me	and	.		.		.

ELAINE	So	we	decided	I	should	go	over	there	and	apply	for	a	job	myself	.
GEORGE	Apply	for	a	job	?	What	for	?
