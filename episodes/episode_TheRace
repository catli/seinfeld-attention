ELAINE	Whos	he	?
JERRY	Elaine	,	only	one	other	person	in	the	world	knows	what	I	am	about	to	tell	you	and	thats	George	.	When	we	were	in	the	ninth	grade	they	had	us	all	line	up	at	one	end	of	the	school	yard	for	this	big	race	to	see	who	was	going	to	represent	the	school	in	this	track	meet	.
ELAINE	Uh
JERRY	I	was	the	last	one	on	the	end	.	George	was	next	to	me	.	And	Mr	.	Bevilacqua	,	the	gym		.		.		.
ELAINE	Whats	that	?
JERRY	Mr	.	Bevilacqua	,	the	gym	teacher	.
ELAINE	Oh	,	of	course	.
JERRY	He	was	down	at	the	other	end	.	So	he	yells	out	,	Ready	,	On	your	mark	,	Get	set	,	and	I	was	so	keyed	up	I	just	took	off	.	By	the	time	he	said	go	I	was	ten	yards	ahead	of	everybody	.
ELAINE	No	.
GEORGE	I	looked	up	.	I	couldnt	believe	it	.
JERRY	By	the	time	the	race	was	over	I	had	won	.	I	was	shocked	nobody	had	noticed	the	head	start	.
ELAINE	Really	?
JERRY	And	I	had	won	by	so	much	a	myth	began	to	grow	about	my
ELAINE	Well	what	happened	when	you	raced	him	again	?
JERRY	I	never	did	.	In	four	years	of	high	school	I	would	never	race	anyone	again	.	Not	even	to	the	end	of	the	block	to	catch	a	bus	.	And	so	the	legend	grew	.	Everyone	wanted	me	to	race	.	They	begged	me	.	The	track	coach	called	my	parents	.	Pleading	.	Telling	them	it	was	a	sin	to	waste	my	god	given	talent	.	But	I	answered	him	in	the	same	way	I	answered	everyone	.	I	chose	not	to	run	.
ELAINE	So	now	Duncan	is	back	?
JERRY	Hes	back	.	And	I	knew	he	would	be	someday	.	Man

JERRY	I	did	not	cheat	.
LOIS	He	said	that	you	got	a	head	start	.
JERRY	Oh	,	hes	just	jealous	because	he	came	in	second	.
LOIS	Really	?

GEORGE	C-Communist	?	I	am	a	Yankee	,	sir	,	first	and	foremost	.
STEINBRENNER	You	know	George	,	it	struck	me	today	me	that	a	Communistpipeline	into	the	vast	reservoir	of	Cuban	baseball	talent	could	be	thegreatest	thing	ever	to	happen	to	this	organization	.
GEORGE	Sir	?
STEINBRENNER	You	could	be	invaluable	to	this	franchise	.	George	,
GEORGE	Yes	,	sir	.	Yes	sir	,	do	my	best	.
STEINBRENNER	Good	,	Merry	Christmas	George	.	And	bring	me	back	some	of	those	cigars	in	the	cedar	boxes	,	you	know	the	ones	with	the	fancy	rings	?	I	love	those	fancy	rings	.	They	kind	of	distract	you	while	youre	smoking	.	The	red	and	yellow	are	nice	.	It	looks	good	against	the	brown	of	the	cigar	.	The	Maduro	,	I	like	the	Maduro	wrapper	.	The	darker	the	better	,	thats	what	I	say	.	Of	course	,	the	Claros	good	too	.	Thats	more	of	a	pale	brown	,	almost	like	a	milky	coffee	.	I	find	the	ring	size	very	confusing	.	They	have	it	in	centimeters	which	I	dont	really	understand	that	well	.		.		.
MICKEY	That	was	quick	!	Nice	job	,	Santa	!
KRAMER	Yeah	,
MICKEY	I	knew	that	Commie	stuff	was	going	to	get	us	in	trouble	.
KRAMER	Yeah	,	well	I	didnt	realize	that	was	such	a	sensitive	issue	.
MICKEY	Communism	,	You	didnt	realize	Communism	was	a	sensitive	issue	?	What	do	you	think	has	been	going	on	in	the	world	for	the	past	years	?	Wake	up	and	smell	the	coffee	.
MICKEY	You	sure	did	.	Big	time	.
ELAINE	How	do	you	feel	?
JERRY	I	need	a	miracle	.
DUNCAN	Now	youre	going	to	see	what	kind	of	liar	youre	mixed	up	with	.
LOIS	If	he	beats	you	I	want	a	big	raise	.
DUNCAN	If	he	beats	me	,	Ill	not	only	give	you	a	raise	,	Ill	send	you	to	Hawaii	for	two	weeks	.
KRAMER	I	parked	in	front	of	that	restaurant		.	As	soon	as	this	race	is	over	I	got	to	go	to	the	airport	.
GEORGE	Okay	,	all	right	,	all	right	.
BEVILACQUA	You	ready	boys	?
JERRY	Yes	,	Mr	.
BEVILACQUA	Okay	,	this	is	hoiw	it	works	.	You	take	your	marks	,	I	say	,	READY	-	ON	YOUR	MARK	-	GET	SET	-	and	then	fire	.	You	got	it	?
DUNCAN	and	JERRY	Yes	Mr	.	Bevilacqua	.
BEVILACQUA	READY	-	ON	YOUR	MARK
LOIS	So	will	you	come	to	Hawaii	with	me	Jerry	?
JERRY	Maybe	I	will		,	Lois	.	Maybe	I	will	.
GEORGE	You	wanted	to	see	me	,	El	Presidente	?
CASTRO	Si	,	si	.	Come	here	.
GEORGE	Si	,	si	.
CASTRO	Ordinarily	I	would	not	grant	such	a	request	but	Ive	heard
GEORGE	Muy	sumpatico	.	Muy	muy	muy	.
CASTRO	Well	good	,	then	you	can	have	your	pick	.
GEORGE	Oh	,	oh	!
CASTRO	They	will	play	for	your	Yankees	.
GEORGE	Oh	well	,	gracias	El	Commandante	,	gracias	.	Muy	muy	.
CASTRO	And	I	would	be	honored	if	you	would	be	my	guest	for	dinner	tonight	at	the	Presidential	palace	.	There	will	be	girls	there	and	,	I	hear	,	some	pretty	good	food	.	Of	course	the	problem	with	parties	is	you	invariably	have	to	eat	standing	up	which	I	dont	care	for	but	on	the	other	hand	I	dont	like	to	balance	a	plate	on	my	lap	either	.	Once	when	I	was	at	a	party	,	I	put	my	plate	on	someones	piano	.	I	assure	you	,	if	I	had	not	been	a	dictator	,	I	would	not	have	been	able	to	get	away	with	that	one	.
