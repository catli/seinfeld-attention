ELAINE
JAMES	This	is	your	wake	up	service	.	Its
ELAINE	Oh	,	god	.	OH	,	I	could	use	a	few	more	hours	sleep	.
JAMES	Hot	date	last	night	?

ELAINE	Really	?	Thank	you	.		,	wake	up	service		.		.		.	person	.
JAMES	Call	me	James	.
ELAINE	Oh	,	all	right	,	James	.	He	he
GEORGE	Your	wake	up	guy	asked	you	out	?
ELAINE	Yeah	,	Ive	never	seen	him	but	I	feel	like	we	have	this	weirdly	intimate	relationship	.	I	mean	,	Im	lying	in	bed	,	Im	wearing	my	nightie	,
JERRY	I	dont	know	.	Blind	date	?
ELAINE	What	?	Youre	going	to	go	out	with	my	cousin	Holly	.	Youve	never	met	her	.
JERRY	Yeah	,	but	Ive	seen	pictures	of	her	.
ELAINE	At	least	Ive	spoken	to	my	guy	.	Youre	going	out	on	a	deaf	date	.
JERRY	I	think	Id	rather	go	out	on	a	deaf	date	than	a	blind	date	.	The	question	is	whether	youd	rather	date	the	blind	or	the	deaf	.
ELAINE	Ah	,		.		.		.
GEORGE	Now	youre	off	on	a	topic	.
JERRY	You	know	,	I	think	,	I	would	rather	date	the	deaf	.
ELAINE	Uh	hu	.
JERRY	Because	I	think	the	blind	would	probably	be	a	little	messier	around	the	house	.	And	lets	face	it	theyre	not	going	to	get	all	the	crumbs	.	Id	possibly	be	walking	around	with	a	sponge	.
GEORGE	You	see	I	disagree	.	Id	rather	be	dating	the	blind	.	You	know	you	could	let	the	house	go	.	You	could	let	yourself	go	.	A	good	looking	blind	woman	doesnt	even	know	youre	not	good	enough	for	her	.
ELAINE	I	think	shed	figure	it	out	.
ELAINE	What	?	What	is	this	?
JERRY	Veggie	sandwich	and	a	grapefruit	.
ELAINE	Veggie	sandwich	and	a	grapefruit	?	What	are	you	turning	into	?

WILHELM	I	understand	.
JERRY	I	still	cant	believe	,	youre	going	out	on	a	blind	date	.
ELAINE	Im	not	worried	.	It	sounds	like	hes	really	good	looking	.
JERRY	Youre	going	by	sound	?	What	are	we	?	Whales	?
ELAINE	I	think	I	can	tell	.
JERRY	Elaine	,	what	percentage	of	people	would	you	say	are	good	looking	?
ELAINE	Twenty-five	percent	.
JERRY	Twenty-five	percent	,	you	say	?	No	way	!	Its	like	to	percent	.	Its	a	twenty	to	one	shot	.

GEORGE	Yeah	,	yeah	.	You	must	have	squirted	a	piece	of	pulp	in	it	too	.
JERRY	Pulp	couldnt	make	it	across	the	table	.
GEORGE	Pulp	can	move	,	Baby	!	Why	didnt	you	eat	a	real	breakfast	?
JERRY	Hey	,	I	eat	healthy	.	If	I	have	to	take	out	an	eye	,	thats	the	breaks	.
GEORGE	Wait	a	minute	.	I	must	have	been	winking	down	at	the	office	.	Thats	why	Mr	.	Wilhelm	was	acting	so	mysteriouso	.
