SALESWOMAN	Oh	,	Im	afraid	I	couldt	do	that	.	It	wouldnt	be	fair	to	the	other	customers	.
GEORGE	Oh	yes	,	of	course	,	and	we	have	to	be	fair	.		,	i
ELAINE	So	,	I	found	out	who	supplies	the	mannequins	and	I	called	em	up	.
KRAMER	How	did	they	get	your	face	?
ELAINE	I	dont	know	.	They	wouldnt	tell	me	.		,	i

JERRY	So	you	think	youre	not	gonna	get	the	job	because	your	pants	make	a	noise	?
