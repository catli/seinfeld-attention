JERRY	Ive	got	a	black	eye	.
STELLA	Hello	.
JERRY	Elaine	,	this	is	my	aunt	Stella	.
HELEN	STELLA	!	STELLA	!
JERRY	Her	back	hurts	.
STELLA	Humm	.		.		.	We	saw	you	on	The	Tonight	Show	last	week	.
LEO	I	thought	Johnny	was	very	rude	to	you	.	He	didnt	even	let	you	talk	.
JERRY	No	,	no	.
LEO	You	need	some	new	material	.	Ive	heard	you	do	that	dog	routine	three	times	already	.
ELAINE	STELLA	!	STELLA	!
LEO	Listen	,	you	should	get	your	cousin	Jeffrey	to	write	some	material	for	you	.

LEO	You	should	read	the	letters	hes	written	.	Hes	funnier	than	the	whole	bunch	of	you	!	Oh	,	heres	Jack	.	We	should	sit	down	.
STELLA	This	better	be	good	.	Im	missing	Golden	Girls	for	this	.
HELEN	I	hate	her	like	poison	.
JACK	Ladies	and	gentlemen	,	as	you	know	,	every	year	,	Phase	Two	of	the	Pines	of	Mark	Gables	honors	the	previous	year	president	.	And	this	year	we	are	honoring	Morty	Seinfeld	A	man	who	slept	more	hours	on	the	job	than	Ronald	Reagan	.
MORTY	Slept	on	the	job	?
JACK	Being	president	of	the	condo	is	not	easy	.	It	requires	hard	work	,	dedication	,	and	commitment	,	and	unfortunately	he	possesses	none	of	these	qualities	.
HELEN	Hes	joking	.
JACK	His	administration	did	excel	in	one	department	the	hiring	of	incompetents	.
MORTY	Thats	what	you	say	.
JACK	But	we	do	owe	him	a	debt	of	gratitude	because	by	not	fixing	the	crack	in	the	sidewalk	,	he	put	Mrs	Ziven	out	of	commission	for	a	few	weeks	.
